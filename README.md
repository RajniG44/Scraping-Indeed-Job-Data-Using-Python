Stores the data for further analysis or presentation.
Modular structure for code readability.
Technologies Used
Python 3.x: Primary programming language.
BeautifulSoup (bs4): For HTML parsing and data extraction.
Requests: For sending HTTP requests.
Pandas: For data organization (optional).
Selenium: (Optional) For handling dynamic content.
Requirements
Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.x
Required libraries (install using pip):
bash

Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your_username/indeed-job-scraper.git
cd indeed-job-scraper
2. Configure Job Search
Edit the job and Location variables in the main Python file to specify your search query:

Copy code
job = "data+science+internship"  # Replace with desired job role
Location = "Noida%2C+Uttar+Pradesh"  # Replace with desired location
3. Run the Script
Run the script to scrape data from Indeed:

bash
Copy code

Scraped data will be printed to the console.
Optionally, save the output to a CSV file using pandas.
Error Handling
403 Forbidden Error
If you encounter a 403 Error, ensure the following:

Add headers to mimic a browser:
python
Copy code
headers = {
    "User-Agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/110.0.0.0 Safari/537.36"
}
Use Selenium if the website relies on JavaScript for dynamic content loading.
Respect robots.txt guidelines of the website.
